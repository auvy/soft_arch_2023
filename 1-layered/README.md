Layered architecture is one of the most widely used patterns. This is a simple 3-layer implementation. It focuses on separation of concern of the entire system.



BL is Business (logic) Layer and handles flow of data and operations

DAL is Data Access Layer and handles data access and storage and retrieval etc

PL is Presentation Layer and handles interface and inputs
